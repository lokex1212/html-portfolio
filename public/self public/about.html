<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Lokesh Sharma, a passionate full-stack web developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. 
  I specialize in building modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems. 
  With a background in science and logical reasoning, I aim to create not just functional websites, but intelligent and 
  scalable digital solutions.</p>

<p>Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics (PCM), 
  I’ve built a strong command over technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Python. 
  My interest in technology and problem-solving has driven me to self-learn full-stack development, combining scientific 
  thinking with creative design to build full-fledged web applications.</p>

<p>My goal is to contribute to impactful projects—whether it's for startups, established businesses, 
  or freelance clients—by writing clean code, following best practices, and continuously learning. 
  I’m currently open to freelance opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out if you’re looking for someone 
  reliable to bring your web vision to life.</p>
